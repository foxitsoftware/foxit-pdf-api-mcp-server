   ```

5. Choose your configuration scope:
   - **User Setting**: Global configuration for all VS Code projects
   - **Workspace Setting**: Project-specific configuration

6. When prompted, enter your Foxit Cloud API credentials

The configuration will be saved as:

```json
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "name": "Foxit Cloud API MCP Server",
    "description": "MCP Server for Foxit Cloud API PDF manipulation tools",
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "foxit-cloudapi-mcp-service",
    "args": [
        "--host",
        "https://na1.fusion.foxit.com/pdf-services",
        "--client_id",
        "${input:client-id}",
        "--client_secret",
        "${input:client-secret}"
    ]
}
```

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the Server

1. **Using VS Code Interface**:
   - Open `.vscode/mcp.json` or your user settings
   - Click the **Start** button that appears above the server configuration
   - Enter your credentials when prompted (stored securely for future use)

2. **Verify Server Status**:
   - Open GitHub Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I` / `Cmd+Ctrl+I`)
   - Switch to **Agent mode** in the chat view
   - Click the **Tools** button to view available MCP servers
   - Confirm "Foxit Cloud API MCP Server" is listed and running

### Making Your First Request

Once the server is running, you can interact with PDF tools through natural language in GitHub Copilot Chat:

```
@copilot /agent Convert this PDF to Word format
@copilot /agent Extract text from the uploaded PDF
@copilot /agent Merge these PDF files
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Server fails to start**: Check the "MCP Server Logs" in VS Code's Output panel
- **Authentication errors**: Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure no other services are using the required ports
- **Missing dependencies**: Reinstall the package and check Python version
